# Pi-hole
Today, I focused on deepening my knowledge of Linux and system administration:

Learned and practiced essential Linux commands to navigate the terminal and manage files and processes.

 tudied the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors, understanding how they are used in virtualization environments.

Explored VMware as a Type 2 hypervisor and learned how to create and manage virtual machines with it.

Successfully set up Pi-hole on a virtual machine to block ads and track DNS requests locally.

I'm making steady progress in understanding virtual infrastructure and Linux system tools. Looking forward to applying more advanced configurations soon!
